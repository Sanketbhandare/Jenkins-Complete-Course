### Course Requirements:
 1. **Laptop (with admin privileges)**
 2. **Desire to Learn**.

---

## **Module 1: Introduction to Jenkins**
- **What is Jenkins**: Open-source automation server for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
- **Jenkins Architecture**: Master-slave setup, Jenkins nodes, and executors.
- **Jenkins UI**: Explore the dashboard, job configuration, and build status.

---

## **Module 2: Jenkins Installation & Setup**
- **Install Jenkins**: Set up Jenkins on different platforms (Linux, Windows, Docker).
- **Configuration**: Set up global configurations (JDK, Git, etc.) and security (user permissions, authorization).

---

## **Module 3: Jenkins Jobs & Pipelines**
- **Freestyle Jobs**: Create and configure basic Jenkins jobs.
- **Pipeline Jobs**: Write declarative and scripted pipelines in Jenkins.
- **Job Triggers**: Trigger builds manually, via SCM, or on a schedule.

---

## **Module 4: Jenkins Plugins**
- **Installing Plugins**: Install and configure essential Jenkins plugins (e.g., Git, Docker, Maven, etc.).
- **Managing Plugins**: Update and manage installed plugins for extended functionality.
  
---

## **Module 5: Jenkins Pipeline Scripting**
- **Declarative Pipelines**: Define CI/CD pipelines in a simplified syntax.
- **Scripted Pipelines**: Write more flexible pipelines using Groovy scripting language.
- **Pipeline Stages**: Define build, test, and deploy stages within pipelines.

---

## **Module 6: Jenkins CI/CD Integration**
- **Version Control Integration**: Integrate Jenkins with Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- **Build Triggers**: Automatically trigger builds on code commits or pull requests.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automate code testing, compilation, and integration.

---

## **Module 7: Jenkins & Docker Integration**
- **Docker in Jenkins**: Run Jenkins builds in Docker containers for isolated environments.
- **Docker Plugins**: Use Docker-related plugins to manage Docker images and containers.
- **Docker Registry**: Push built images to Docker Hub or private registries.

---

## **Module 8: Jenkins Security & User Management**
- **User Authentication**: Configure user access control, authentication (LDAP, Active Directory).
- **Permissions**: Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for Jenkins users.
- **Pipeline Security**: Secure sensitive data in Jenkins pipelines using credentials.

---

## **Module 9: Jenkins Monitoring & Maintenance**
- **Job Monitoring**: Monitor the status of Jenkins jobs, build logs, and health.
- **System Logs**: Check Jenkins logs for errors and troubleshoot issues.
- **Backup & Recovery**: Backup Jenkins configurations and restore them when needed.

---

## **Module 10: End-to-End Project**
1. **Step 1: Install Jenkins**:
   - Set up Jenkins on a server or Docker container.
2. **Step 2: Create a Pipeline Job**:
   - Create and configure a basic Jenkins pipeline to automate a sample project.
3. **Step 3: Integrate GitHub/Bitbucket**:
   - Connect Jenkins with a Git repository to trigger builds on code changes.
4. **Step 4: Write Pipeline Script**:
   - Define stages for building, testing, and deploying the application.
   - Use both declarative and scripted pipelines.
5. **Step 5: Integrate with Docker**:
   - Use Docker for isolated build environments and push Docker images to a registry.
6. **Step 6: Implement Security**:
   - Configure Jenkins security (user permissions, credentials) and pipeline security.
7. **Step 7: Set Up Build Triggers**:
   - Trigger builds on push events or scheduled intervals (using webhooks, Git hooks).
8. **Step 8: Implement Continuous Delivery (CD)**:
   - Automatically deploy successful builds to staging or production environments.

---

## **Module 11: Final Project**
- **Complete CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automate the entire software delivery process from code commit to deployment.
   - Integrate GitHub, Docker, and Jenkins to build, test, and deploy an application (e.g., Node.js or Python web app).
   - Use Jenkins plugins, such as Docker and Maven, to enhance the pipeline.
   - Ensure security, job monitoring, and system maintenance.
